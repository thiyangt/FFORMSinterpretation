\begin{abstract}
Features of time series are useful in identifying suitable models for
forecasting. Talagala, Hyndman \& Athanasopoulos (2018) proposed a
classification framework, labelled FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model
Selection), which selects forecast models based on features calculated
from the time series. The FFORMS framework builds a mapping that relates
the features of a time series to the ``best'' forecast model using the
random forest algorithm. In this paper we explore what is happening
under the hood of the FFORMS framework. This is accomplished using
model-agnostic machine learning interpretability approaches. The
analysis provides a valuable insight into how different features and
their interactions affect the choice of forecast model selection. This
gives a more refined picture of the relationship between features and
the choice of forecast model which is particularly valuable for ongoing
research in the field of feature-based time series analysis.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

The filed of time series forecasting field has been evolving for a few
decades now and has introduced a wide variety of models for forecasting.
However, for a given time series the selection of an appropriate
forecast-model among many possibilities is not straight forward. This
selection is one of the most difficult tasks as each method perform best
for some but not all tasks. The features of a time series are considered
to be an important factor in identifying suitable forecasting models
\autocites{collopy1992rule}{meade2000evidence}{makridakis2000m3}{wang2009rule}.
However, a comprehensive description of the relationship between the
features and the performance of algorithms is rarely discussed.

There have been several recent studies on the use of meta-learning
approaches to automate the forecast-model selection based on the
features computed from the time series
\autocites{shah1997model}{prudencio2004meta}{lemke2010meta}{kuck2016meta}.
Meta-learning approach provides a systematic guidance on model selection
based on knowledge acquired from historical data sets. The key idea is,
forecast-model selection is posed as a supervised learning task. Each
time series in the meta-data set is represented as a vector of features
and labelled according to the ``best'' forecast-model (i.e.~for example
model with lowest MASE over a test set, etc.). Then a meta-learner is
trained to identify a suitable forecast-model (usually a machine
learning algorithm is used). In the era of big data, such an automated
model selection process is necessary because the cost of invoking all
possible forecast-models is prohibitive. However, existing literature
suffers from the limitation of providing answers to questions such as:
i) How features are related to the property being modelled?; ii) How
features interact with each other to identify a suitable
forecast-model?; iii) Which features contribute most to the
classification process?, etc. Addressing such questions can enhance the
understanding of the relations between features and model selection
outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, a very limited effort has been
taken to understand how the meta-learners are making its decisions and
what is really happening inside these complex model structures.
Providing transparency will result, building trust in the prediction
results of the meta-learner.

Furthermore, besides from the goal of developing an automated
forecast-model selection framework very few researchers have made an
attempt to provide a description of the relationship between the
features and the choice of different forecast-models
\autocites{schnaars1984situational}{wang2009rule}{lemke2010meta}{petropoulos2014horses}.
These studies are limited by the scale of problem instances used, the
diversity of forecast-models implemented, and the limited number of
features considered to identify the relationship between features and
forecast-model performance.

To fill this gap, this paper makes a first step towards providing a
comprehensive analysis of the relationship between time series features
and forecast-model selection using machine learning interpretability
techniques. This paper builds on the method from our previous work
\textcite{fforms}, in which we introduced the FFORMS (Feature-based
FORecast Model Selection) framework. A random forest is used to model
the relationship between features and ``best'' performing
forecast-model. A large collection of time series is used to train the
meta-learner.

In this article, we make the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We extend the FFORMS framework to handle weekly, daily and hourly
  series. We also extend the diversity of forecast-models used as class
  labels. The contribution of this paper differs from previously
  published work related to meta-learning
  \autocites{prudencio2004meta}{lemke2010meta}{kuck2016meta} in three
  ways : i) a more extensive collection of features is used (35
  different feature types are used which are simple and easy to
  compute), ii) the diversity of forecast-models considered as class
  labels, and iii) capability of handling high frequency data;
\item
  We analyse the application of the FFORMS framework to the
  M4-competition data. We generated point forecasts and prediction
  intervals for the M4-competition time series data, and is shown to
  yield accurate forecast comparable to several benchmarks and other
  commonly used automated approaches of time series forecasting. Our
  approach achieved a high accuracy rate based on individual
  forecast-model selection rule.
\item
  The main contribution of the paper is to explore the relationship
  between features of time series and the choice of forecast-model
  selection using the FFORMS framework. We explore the role of features
  in two different perspectives: i) Global perspective of feature
  contribution: the overall role of features in the choice of different
  forecast-models and ii) Local perspective of feature contribution: we
  zoom into local regions of the data to identify which features
  contribute most to classify a specific instance.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In \autoref{fforms}
we describe the application of FFORMS framework to M4-competition data.
\autoref{machinelearning} gives background on machine learning
interpretability techniques that are used to identify role of features
in forecast model selection. In \autoref{results} we discuss the
results. \autoref{conclusions} concludes.

\section{FFORMS application to M4 competition data}\label{fforms}

The FFORMS framework consists of two main components: i) \emph{offline
phase}, which includes the development of a meta-learner and ii)
\emph{online phase}, using the meta-learner identify the ``best''
forecast-model. We develop separate classifiers for yearly, monthly,
quarterly, weekly, daily and hourly series.

\subsection{FFORMS framework: offline
phase}\label{fforms-framework-offline-phase}

\subsubsection{Reference set}\label{reference-set}

We call the total collection of time series used for training the
meta-leaner as the ``reference set''. The reference set consist of two
set of time series: i) observed sample and ii) simulated time series.

\subsubsection{Observed sample}\label{observed-sample}

We use the time series from the M1, M3 and M4 competitions as the
observed sample. Note that from the M4 competition randomly selected
subset of time series are used for the observed sample. The rest is used
to evaluate the meta-learner. Table \ref{observedsample} summarizes the
number of time series in the observed sample.

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\caption{Composition of the time series in the observed sample and the test set}
\label{observedsample}
\begin{tabular}{l|rrr}
\multirow{2}{*}{Frequency} & \multicolumn{3}{l}{Observed Sample} \\
                  &   M1    &    M3   &    M4  \\ \hline
  Yearly          &   181    &   645    &   22000  \\
  Quarterly       &   203    &    756   &   23000\\
  Monthly         &   617    &    1428   &  47000\\
  Weekly          &   -    &   -    &   259\\
  Daily           &   -    &   -    &   4001\\
  Hourly          &   -    &    -   &  350\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Simulated time series}\label{simulated-time-series}

As described in \textcite{fforms}, we augment the reference set by
adding multiple time series simulated based on each series in the M4
competition. We use several automated algorithms to simulate multiple
time series. Table \ref{simulation} shows the data generating algorithms
used for each frequency. The \texttt{ets()} and \texttt{auto.arima()}
functions available in the forecast package in R \autocite{forecast} are
used to simulate yearly, quarterly and monthly data from exponential
smoothing and ARIMA models. The \texttt{stlf()} function also available
in the forecast package is used to simulate multiple time series based
on multiple seasonal decomposition approach. Using the above functions
we fit models to each time series in the M4 database and then simulate
multiple time series from the selected models. In this experiment the
length of the simulated time series is set to be equal to: length of the
training period specified in the M4 competition + length of the forecast
horizon specified in the competition. For example, the series with id
``Y13190'' contains a training period of length 835. The length of the
simulated series generated based on this series is equals to 841
(835+6). Before simulating time series from daily and hourly series we
convert the time series into multiple seasonal time series (msts)
objects. For daily time series with length less than 366, the frequency
set to 7 and longer time series are converted to multiple seasonal time
series objects with frequencies set to 7 and 365.25. For hourly series,
we set the frequencies to 24 and 168 to handle multiple frequencies
corresponds to time-of-day pattern and time-of-week pattern
respectively.

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\caption{Automatic forecasting algorithms used to simulate time series}
\label{simulation}
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
 Algorithm & Y & Q & M & W & D &  H \\ \hline
 ets() & \checkmark & \checkmark & \checkmark &  &  &  \\
auto.arima() & \checkmark & \checkmark & \checkmark &  &  &  \\
stlf() &  &  &  & \checkmark & \checkmark & \checkmark\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We should reemphasise that all the observed time series and the
simulated time series form the reference set to build our meta-learner.
Once we create the reference set for random forest training we split
each time series in the reference set into training period and test
period.

\subsubsection{Input: features}\label{input-features}

The FFORMS framework operates on features calculated from the time
series. For each time series in the reference set, features are
calculated based on the training period of the time series.

The description of the features calculated under each frequency category
is shown in Table \ref{feature}. A comprehensive description of the

\subsubsection{Output: class-labels}\label{output-class-labels}

The description of class labels considered under each frequency is shown
in Table \ref{classlabels}. Note that these added to \textcite{fforms}.
We fit the corresponding models outlined in Table \ref{classlabels} to
each series in the reference set. The models are estimated using the
training period for each series, and forecasts are produced for the test
periods. Most of the labels given in Table \ref{classlabels} are
self-explanatory labels. In STL-AR, mstlets, and mstlarima, first STL
decomposition method applied to the time series and then seasonal naive
method is used to forecast the seasonal component. Finally, AR, ETS and
ARIMA models are used to forecast seasonally adjusted data respectively.

Accoding to the \textcite{M4compguide}, in the M4-competition the
forecast accuracy is evaluated based on the mean Absolute Scaled Error
(MASE) and the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Hence,
in order to identify the ``best'' forecast-model for each time series in
the reference set we combine MASE and the symmetric MAPE calculated over
the test set. More specifically, for each series both forecast error
measures MASE and sMAPE are calculated for each of the forecast models.
Each of these is respectively standardized by the median MASE and median
sMAPE calculated across the forecast-models. The model with the lowest
average value of the scaled MASE and scaled sMAPE is selected as the
output class-label.

\subsubsection{Train a random forest
classifier}\label{train-a-random-forest-classifier}

A random forest algorithm is used to train the meta-learner. We build
separate random forest classifiers for yearly, quarterly, monthly,
weekly, daily and hourly time series. The wrapper function called
\texttt{build\_rf} in the \texttt{seer} package (available at:
\url{https://github.com/thiyangt/seer}) enables the training of a random
forest.

\subsection{FFORMS framework: online
phase}\label{fforms-framework-online-phase}

The online phase of the algorithm involves generating point forecasts
and 95\% prediction intervals for the new series or the future values
observed time series. First, the corresponding features are calculated
based on the full length of the training period provided by the M4
competition. Second, point forecasts and 95\% prediction intervals are
calculated based on the predicted class labels. We should note that all
negative forecasts are set to zero.

\section{Peeking inside FFORMS}\label{machinelearning}

The main objective of this paper is to explore the nature of the
relationship between features and forecast-model selection learned by
the FFORMS framework. More specifically, to identify which of the
features are important for model predictions and how different features
and their interactions led to the different choices. We use both
model-diagnostic approaches and machine learning interpretability
approaches to evaluate our framework.

\subsection{Model-diagnostics}\label{model-diagnostics}

Model-diagnostic is an important aspect in evaluating the accuracy of
the model's predictions as well as the model's understanding of the
nature of the relationship between features and predicted outcome. We
next explain the model-diagnostics tools considered in this paper.

\subsubsection{Out-of-bag (OOB) error and uncertainty measure for each
observation}\label{out-of-bag-oob-error-and-uncertainty-measure-for-each-observation}

It is argued in order to estimate the test error of a bagged model it is
not necessary to perform cross-validation approach, because each tree is
grown using different bootstrap samples from the training set and a part
of training data is not used in the tree construction
(\textcite{breiman2001random}; \textcite{chen2004using}). In general,
each bagged tree does not make use of around one third of observations
to construct the decision tree. These observations are referred to as
the out-of-bag (OOB) observations. Each tree is grown based on different
bootstrap samples hence, each tree has different set of OOB
observations. These OOB samples can be used to calculate internal
estimation of the test set error.

\subsubsection{Representation of model in the data space (m-in-ds) and
data in the model space
(d-in-ms)}\label{representation-of-model-in-the-data-space-m-in-ds-and-data-in-the-model-space-d-in-ms}

\textcite{wickham2015visualizing} explains the importance of displaying
the ``model in the data space (m-in-ds)'' and ``data in the model space
(d-in-ms)''. Displaying the data in the model space (d-in-ms) is the
most commonly used approach for model-diagnostics. For example, plot of
fitted values versus residuals (\textcite{wickham2015visualizing}).
D-in-MS is a visualization of embedding high-dimensional data into a
low-dimensional space generated from the model. Visualization of D-in-MS
do not help to gain an understanding of the nature of the relationship
between features predicted outcome. In order to address this issue
\textcite{wickham2015visualizing} and \textcite{da2017interactive} have
highlighted the importance of visualizations of model in the data space.
In the context of classification, representation of m-in-ds could be
achieved by first, projecting the training data set into meaningful
low-dimensional feature space and then visualize the complete prediction
regions or their boundaries. In other words this can be considered as
the visualization of predictor space in the context of the data space.
See \textcite{wickham2015visualizing} for visualization method of this
kind and \textcite{da2017interactive} for comparable method for random
forest algorithm.

\subsection{Machine Learning
Interpretability}\label{machine-learning-interpretability}

In recent years, there have been a growing interest for interpretability
of machine learning algorithms with the European General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) stipulates the explainability of all automatically
made decision concerning individuals. We explore the role of features in
two different perspectives: i) global explanation of feature
contribution: overall role of features in the choice of different
forecast model selection, and ii) local explanation of feature
contribution: nature of the contributions features make for a prediction
of a specific instance. We will introduce each of these ideas briefly
below.

\subsection{General Notation}\label{general-notation}

Let \(\mathcal{P}=\{(\mathbf{x^{(i)}}, y^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^{N}\) be the
historical data set we use to train a classifier. Consider a
p-dimensional feature vector \(X=(X_1, X_2, ..., X_p)\) and a dependent
variable, the best forecasting method for each series \(Y\). Let
\(\mathcal{G}\) be the unknown relationship between \(X\) and \(Y\).
\textcite{Zhao} term this as ``law of nature''. Inside the FFORMS
framework, random forest algorithm tries to learn this relationship
using the historical data we provided. We denote the predicted function
as \(g\).

\subsection{Global Interpretability
Methods}\label{global-interpretability-methods}

Global interpretability evaluate the behavior of a model on entire data
set. Global perspective of model interpretation helps users to
understand the overall modelled relationship between features and the
model outcome. For example, which features are contribute mostly to the
predictive mechanism of the fitted model, complex interactions between
features, etc. In the following subsections we provide a description of
tools we use to explore the global perspective of the model.

\subsection{Analysis of Feature
contribution}\label{analysis-of-feature-contribution}

\textcite{jiang2002} explains variable importance under three different
views: i) causality: change in the value of Y for a increase or decrease
in the value of x, ii) contribution of X based on out-of-sample
prediction accuracy and iii) face value of X on prediction function
\(g\), for example in linear regression model estimated coefficients of
each predictor can be considered as a measure of variable importance.
See \textcite{jiang2002} for comparable face value interpretation for
machine learning models. In this paper we use the first two notions of
variable importance. Partial dependency functions and individual
conditional expectation curves are used to explore the ``causality''
notion of variable importance while Mean decrease in Gini coefficient
and Permutation-based variable importance are used to capture the second
notion of variable importance-features contribution to the predictive
accuracy (\textcite{Zhao}). We will introduce each of these variable
importance measures below.

\subsubsection{Mean decrease in Gini
coefficient}\label{mean-decrease-in-gini-coefficient}

Mean decrease in Gini coefficient is a measure of how each feature
contributes to the homogeneity of the nodes and leaves in the resulting
random forest proposed by \textcite{breiman2001random}.

\subsubsection{Permutation-based variable importance
measure}\label{permutation-based-variable-importance-measure}

The permutation-based variable importance introduced by
\textcite{breiman2001random} measures the prediction strength of each
feature. This measure is calculated based on the out-of-bag (OOB)
observations. The calculation of variable importance is formalized as
follow: Let \(\bar{\mathcal{B}}^{(k)}\) be the OOB sample for a tree
\(k\), with \(k\in \{1,...,ntree\}\), where \(ntree\) is the number of
trees in the random forest. Then the variable importance of variable
\(X_{j}\) in \(k^{th}\) tree is:
\[VI^{(k)}(X_{j})=\frac{\sum_{i\in \bar{\mathcal{B}}^{(k)}}I(\gamma_{i}=\gamma_{i,\pi_{j}}^{k})}{|\bar{\mathcal{B}}^{(k)}|}-\frac{\sum_{i\in \bar{\mathcal{B}}^{(k)}}I(\gamma_{i}=\gamma_{i}^{k})}{|\bar{\mathcal{B}}^{(k)}|},\]
where \(\gamma_{i}^{k}\) denotes the predicted class for the \(i^{th}\)
observation before permuting the values of \(X_{j}\) and
\(\gamma_{i, \pi_{j}}^{k}\) is the predicted class for the \(i^{th}\)
observation after permuting the values of \(X_{j}\). The overall
variable importance score is calculated as:
\[VI(X_{j})=\frac{\sum_{1}^{ntree}VI^{(t)}(x_{j})}{ntree}.\]

Permutation-based variable importance measures provide a useful starting
point for identifying relative influence of features on the predicted
outcome. However, they provide a little indication of the nature of the
relationship between the features and model outcome. To gain further
insights into the role of features inside the FFORMS framework we use
partial dependence plot (PDP) introduced by
\textcite{friedman2008predictive}.

\subsubsection{Partial dependence plot
(PDP)}\label{partial-dependence-plot-pdp}

Partial dependence plot can be used to graphically examine how each
feature is related to the model prediction while accounting for the
average effect of other features in the model. Let \(X_s\) be the subset
of feature we want examine partial dependencies for and \(X_c\) be the
remaining set of features in \(X\). Then \(g_s\), the partial dependence
function on \(X_s\) is defines as
\[g_s(X_s)=E_{x_c}[g(x_s, X_c)]=\int{g(x_s, x_c)dP(x_c).}\] In practice,
PDP can be estimated from a training data set as
\[\bar{g_s}(x_s)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}g(x_s, X_{iC}),\] where \(n\)
is the number of observations in the training data set. Partial
dependency curve can be created by plotting the pairs of
\(\{(x_s^k, \bar{g}_s(x_{sk}))\}_{k=1}^{m}\) defined on grid of points
\(\{x_{s1}, x_{s2},\dots, x_{sm}\}\) based on \(X_s\). FFORMS framework
has treated the forecast-model selection problem as a classification
problem. Hence, in this paper partial dependency functions displays the
probability of certain class occurring given different values of feature
\(X_s\).

\subsubsection{Variable importance measure based on
PDP}\label{variable-importance-measure-based-on-pdp}

\textcite{Greenwell2018} introduced a variable importance measure based
on the partial dependency curves. The idea is to measure the
``flatness'' of partial dependence curves for each feature. A feature
whose PDP curve is flat, relative to the other features, indicates that
the feature does not have much influence on the predicted value as it
changes while taking into account the average effect of the other
features in the model. The flatness of the curve is measured using the
standard deviation of the values \(\{\bar{g}_{s}(x_{sk})\}_{k=1}^{m}\).

\subsubsection{Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE)
curves}\label{individual-conditional-expectation-ice-curves}

While partial dependency curves are useful in understanding the
estimated relationship between features and the predicted outcome in the
presence of substantial interaction between features, it can be
misleading. \textcite{goldstein2015peeking} proposed the Individual
Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves to address this issue. Instead of
averaging \(g(x_s, X_{iC})\) over all observations in the training data,
ICE plots the individual response curves by plotting the pairs
\(\{(x_s^k, g(x_{sk}, X_{iC}))\}_{k=1}^{m}\) defined on grid of points
\(\{x_{s1}, x_{s2},\dots, x_{sm}\}\) based on \(X_s\). In other words
partial dependency curve is simply the average of all the ICE curves.

\subsubsection{Variable importance measure based on ICE
curves}\label{variable-importance-measure-based-on-ice-curves}

This method is similar to the PDP-based VI scores above, but are based
on measuring the ``flatness'' of the individual conditional expectation
curves. We calculated standard deviations of each ICE curve. We then
computed a ICE based variable importance score -- simply the average of
all the standard deviations. A higher value indicates a higher degree of
interactivity with other features.

\subsection{Assessment of Interaction
Effect}\label{assessment-of-interaction-effect}

Friedman's H-statistic (\textcite{friedman2008predictive}) is use to
test the presence of interaction between all possible pair of features.
This statistic is computed based on the partial dependence functions.
For two way interaction between two specific variable \(x_j\) and
\(x_k\), Friedman's H-statistic is defined as follow,

\[H_{jk}^2=\sum_{i=1}^{n}[\bar{g}_{s}(x_{ij}, x_{jk})-\bar{g}_{s}(x_{ij})-\bar{g}_{s}(x_{ik})]^2/\sum_{i=1}^{n}\bar{g}^2_{s}(x_{ij}, x_{jk}).\]

The Friedman's H-statistic measures the fraction of variance of
two-variable partial dependency, \(\bar{g}_{s}(x_{ij}, x_{jk})\) not
captured by sum of the respective individual partial dependencies,
\(\bar{g}_{s}(x_{ij})+\bar{g}_{s}(x_{ik})\). In addition to Friedman's
H-statistic we also use the PDP of two variables to visualize the
interaction effect.

Note that the, PD plots, ICE curves and PD-, ICE-associated measures and
Friedman's H-statistic are computationally intensive to compute,
especially when there are large number of observations in the training
set. Hence, in our experiments ICE and PDP-based variable importance are
computed based on the subset of randomly selected training examples.

\subsection{Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
(LIME)}\label{local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations-lime}

Global interpretations help us to understand the entire modelled
relationship. Local interpretations help us to understand the
predictions of the model for a single instance or a group of similar
instances. In other words this allows users to zoom into a particular
instance or a subset and explore how different features affect the
resulting prediction. We use Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explanations (LIME) approach introduce by \textcite{ribeiro2016should}
for explaining individual predictions which relies on the assumption
that ``every complex model is linear on a local scale''. This is
accomplished by locally approximating the complex black-box model with a
simple interpretable model. \textcite{ribeiro2016should} highlighted
features that are globally important may not be important in the local
context and vice verse. The algorithm steps can be summarized as follow:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Select an observation of interest which we need to have explanations
  for its black-box prediction.
\item
  Create a permuted data set based on the selected observation. Permuted
  data set is created by making slight modifications to the features of
  selected observations.
\item
  Obtain similarity scores by calculating distance between permuted data
  and selected observation.
\item
  Obtain predicted outcomes for all permuted data using the black-box
  model.
\item
  Select \(m\) number of features best describing the black-box model
  outcome. This can be accomplished by applying feature selection
  algorithms such as ridge regression, lasso, etc.
\item
  Fit a simple linear model to the permuted data based on \(m\) selected
  features, similarity scores in step 3 as weights and complex model
  prediction outcomes in step 4 as response variable.
\item
  Use the estimated coefficients of simple linear model to explain the
  local behaviour corresponds to the selected observation in step 1.
\end{enumerate}

An alternative for explaining local behaviour of complex models is
proposed by \textcite{lundberg2017unified} based on game theory named
``Shapley values''.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\newpage

\subsection{Yearly data}\label{yearly-data}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{figures/yearlyoob-1.png}
\caption{\label{fig:yearlyoob}The vote matrix representation of the random
forest based on OOB sample. The Y-axis denotes what was predicted from
the random forest. The X-axis denotes the proportion of times each time
series was classified to each class. The colours of boxplots corresponds
to class label of ``best'' forecast-model identified based on MASE and
sMAPE. On each row, distribution of correctly classified class
dominates, indicating a good classification of the meta-learner.}
\end{figure}

According to \autoref{fig:yearlyoob} distributions of correctly
classified classes dominate, indicating a good classification of the
meta-learner. The random walk with drift has a high chance of getting
selected with yearly time series. The results of M4-competition also
shows random walk with drift perform well with yearly time series. The
forecast-models, neural network and theta also have a high chance of
getting selected as they represent a more general class of
forecast-models. Furthermore, FFORMS framework successfully learnt the
similarities and dissimilarities between the classes itself. For
example, within ETS-trend predicted class, the distributions correspond
to the true class labels, ETS-damped trend, ARIMA, were also assigned
with high probability and less values were assigned to ARMA/AR/MA, White
noise process and ETS (ANN)/ ETS(MNN).

\autoref{fig:viyearly} shows how important each one of the features we
considered within each class as well as in the overall classification
mechanism of the FFORMS. To identify class-specific important features
we rank features in three different ways: i) based on permutation-based
variable importance, ii) based on partial dependence functions and iii)
based on ICE-curves. We consider 25 features for yearly data. The
feature that shows the highest importance is ranked 25, the second best
is ranked 24, and so on. Finally, for each feature, a mean rank is
calculated based on the rankings of the three measures. Similarly, the
overall feature importance is evaluated based on permutation-based
variable importance measure and Gini coefficient-based feature
importance measure.

According to \autoref{fig:pdpyearly}, the features related to strength
of trend, nonstationarity (ur\_pp, diff1y\_acf1), overall shape of the
trend (linear: measured by linearity, damped trend:measured by beta,
exponential: measured by curvature) and measures of randomness (from
spikiness, and lmres\_acf1) are the most important for the choice of
yearly time series forecast-models. The first ACF value of the original
series (y\_acf1) appears among top five within random walk with drift
class and ARMA/AR/MA class as it helps to separate stationary and
non-stationary series. The first correlation coefficient of the
twice-differenced series is appear to be the most important in ARIMA
class as this class contains the higher order differenced series. The
Hurst exponent and entropy appear to be equally important in stationary
classes. Within ETS-damped trend class beta and curvature ranked as
important features. The length of time series (N) is assigned relatively
high rank within random walk with drift, ETS-dampedtrend and
neural-network class compared to others. On the other hand, sum of
squares of first five autocorrelation coefficients of the
twice-difference series and lumpiness are the least important feature
across many classes.

\autoref{fig:pdpyearly} shows the partial dependency curves, and
associated confidence intervals of the top-three features that get
selected most in each class. The three features shows a non-linear
relationship with predicted class probabilities. Probability of
selecting ETS-trend, ARIMA, ETS-without seasonal and trend component and
neural network models increases steadily as ur\_pp increases. As
expected probability of selecting stationary models decreases as the
test statistic of Phillip-Perron test increases and this probability
remains zero beyond the value of 0 of ur\_pp.~Random walk with drift,
ETS-trend, ETS-damped trend, ARIMA show an increasing relationship with
trend, whereas random walk, ETS-without trend and seasonal components,
and stationary models show a monotonically deceasing relationship as
trend increases. The theta class shows parabolic relationship with
trend. It is interesting to observe that probability of selecting neural
network models decreases with very high trend value. The reason could be
very clear highly trended series are more likely to select ETS-trend,
ETS-dampedtrend and ARIMA models which lessen the chance of neural
network models for them. The wide confidence bands around the partial
dependency functions of linearity indicated the higher variability of
ICE curves. The probability of selecting random walk with drift
increases rapidly beyond value 0 and remains thereafter. Fro ARMA/AR/MA
class all ICE curve of linearity increase sharply around 0 and decline
steadily after that. Similar relationship can be observed within white
noise class with wide confidence bands whereas ARIMA and neural network
show the opposite relationship. The partial dependency curves of
diff1y\_acf1 indicate probability of selecting random walk with drift
and ETS-trend higher for differenced-stationary series.

\autoref{fig:friedmany} shows the heat maps of relative strength of all
possible pairwise interactions for each class. The relative strength of
two-way interaction between features are measured using the formula
developed by \textcite{friedman2008predictive}, which is implemented in
the \texttt{iml} (\textcite{molnar2018iml},) package in R. Except
ETS-trend class, trend and ur\_pp show a high level of interactivity and
less interactivity with other features. Linearity also show a weak
interaction with other features in all classes. In almost all the cases
partial correlation and auto-correlation based features are heavily
interacting. However, the first correlation coefficient of the
difference series do not interact with other features heavily within
ARIMA class. Further, almost all pair of features appear to be
interacting within neural network category. The interactivity between
stability and lumpiness is the most type interactivity within all
classes.

\subsection{Quarterly and Monthly
data}\label{quarterly-and-monthly-data}

\autoref{fig:oobquarterlymonthly1} - \autoref{fig:oobquarterlymonthly2}
show the vote-matrix of random forests for quarterly and monthly data
respectively based on OOB observations.
\autoref{fig:oobquarterlymonthly1} and
\autoref{fig:oobquarterlymonthly2} depicted similar patterns accorss
classes. For quarterly and monthly data, the same set of features and
class-labels are used to train the model. Hence, this consistency
between the results of quarterly and monthly series would provide
evidence in support of the validity and trustability of the model. The
outliers associated with dominating distributions indicates somes series
are correctly classified with very high probability. Seasonal time
series has a low chance of classified into random walk with drift model
and high chance of selecting SARIMA, stlar and tbats. Except the time
series labelled as ARMA/AR/MA all other quarterly time series have a
very low chance of classified to ARMA/AR/MA class. Further, all
distributions corresponds to the tbats row located further away from
zero. This indicates all time series select tbats model at least once
from the individual trees in the forest. Except few outliers,
distributions within neural network category also show a slight upward
deviation from zero. However, the upper boundary of these distributions
do not surpass the upper boundaries of dominating box plots in the
random walk with drift class and SARIMA class. Further, within stlar,
tbats, theta and neural network classes all distributions level at
similar proportionalities. These types of similarities in the
distributions indicates the the appropriateness of using combination
forecasting. Further, these information are useful in identifying
potential time series models for combination forecast and improve the
existing combination approaches proposed in the M4-competition
(\textcite{Makridakis2018dx}). In addition to that the similarities and
diversities observed in the boxplots indicate the neighbourhood of cases
in their respective instance space.

\autoref{fig:viquarterly} and \autoref{fig:vimonthly} show feature
importance plots for quarterly and monthly data respectively. For both
quarterly and monthly data strength of seasonality, trend, linearity and
spikiness are the most important features across all categories. Even
though the lumpiness does not appear as a top five feature within
classes it is appear to be an important feature in the overall
classification process and a relatively high rank is assigned within
many classes. In the case of yearly data low variable importance is
assigned to both stability and length of the series. However, in
quarterly and monthly data high variable importance is assigned to
length of the series and stability. One notable difference between
quarterly series and monthly series is, for monthly data length of the
series is ranked among top five specially in random walk with drift,
random walk, ETS with seasonal and trend component, ETS-seasonal, SARIMA
and ARIMA classes. In addition to the strength of seasonality, the
models available for handling seasonal components (snaive, SARIMA, all
ETS models with seasonal component) assigned a high importance to the
additional features related to seasonality such as ACF, PACF-based
features related to seasonal lag or seasonally differenced series.
Furthermore, as expected features calculated based on parameter
estimated of ETS(A, A, A) have been ranked as important for the choice
of ETS with damped trend and seasonal component and ETS with trend and
seasonal component.

\autoref{fig:pdpquarterly1} and \autoref{fig:pdpquarterly2} show the
partial dependency functions of the features that get selected most
often in the top. Additionally, PDP of N is included to observe the
effects stated in the literature. Except for random walk, partial
dependency curves of seasonality and trend show a similar behaviour for
both quarterly and monthly data. Hence, for seasonality and trend, the
partial dependency curves computed based quarterly are presented except
for random walk. Probability of selecting a model with a parameter to
handle the seasonal effect (snaive, all ETS models with seasonal
component, SARIMA, tbats, theta, stlar) increases as the seasonality
increases. Further, for classes rwd, all ETS model with trend component,
SARIMA, ARIMA, tbats and theta, have a high probability of getting
selected as the strength of trend increases. On the other hand, opposite
relationships were observed for snaive and ETS-seasonal which accounted
seasonality only. This confirms the idea that the choice of model
selection consistent with the expected relationship. FFORMS framework
trained on quarterly data probability of selecting random walk models
remains stable up to 0.85 value of trend and drops sharply afterwards,
whereas the FFORMS framework trained on monthly data indicates
probability of selecting random walk models increases as trend
increases. This could be due to the interaction effect of trend with
other features. As shown in \autoref{fig:friedmanQ} and
\autoref{fig:friedmanM} trend shows a high interactivity with other
features within random walk class. \autoref{fig:friedmanQ} and
\autoref{fig:friedmanM} show the heat maps of relative strength of all
possible pairwise interactions calculated based on Friedman's
H-statistic for quarterly and monthly data respectively. Within all
classes seasonality show less interactivity with other features, whereas
lumpiness show high interactivity with other features. In addition to
that, for quarterly diff1y\_pacf5 shows a very high interactivity with
other features and for monthly data within many classes linearity,
spikiness, y\_pacf5, and ACF/PACF-based features related to seasonal
lags and beta show an interactivity with all features. For quarterly
data y\_acf1 and y\_acf5 show higher interactivity within random walk
with drift, ETS-seasonal and SARIMA while for monthly all classes show a
high interactivity between y\_acf1 and y\_acf5. Further within each
class, a subset of ACF/PACF-based features shows some interactivity. In
general interactivity between features related to correlation structure
of a time series and overall shape (spikiness, linearity, curvature,
etc) lead to the choice of forecast-model selection.

\subsection{Weekly}\label{weekly}

\autoref{fig:oobweekly} shows the proportion of times each time series
was classified to each class. Unlike, yearly, quarterly and monthly data
theta method have a low chance of being selected to forecast weekly
data. The random walk with drift, tbats models and theta have higher
chance of being selected. Except ARMA/AR/MA class the distribution
corresponds to the true class label dominates others. ARMA/AR/MA class
shows some unusual behaviour within some categories due to class
imbalance ratio, ARMA/AR/MA class contains fewer number of observations
in the training set.

According to the results of \autoref{fig:viweekly} spikiness, linearity,
trend, strength of seasonality, stability and lumpiness has been
assigned a high importance. This is similar to the results of yearly,
quarterly and monthly data. The length of series has been selected among
top 5 by mstlets, tbats, theta and neural network models. According to
the results of \autoref{fig:weeklypdp} for mstlets models probability of
being selected increases as the linearity increases while the opposite
relationship was observed at SARIMA models.

\subsection{Daily and Hourly data}\label{daily-and-hourly-data}

According to \autoref{fig:oobdailyhourly} the distributions corresponds
to observations that have been correctly classified dominated the top
for daily data. However, within daily series there are few observations
that have been incorrectly classified to tbats class with very high
probabilities. In general, neural network models have higher chance of
getting selected for daily time series. Overall, for hourly series
random walk with drift models, tbats and neural network models have high
chance of getting selected. Furthermore, it is important to note that
all hourly series have been assigned non-zero probability of getting
selected to neural network class. Variable importance graph for daily
and hourly data are shown in \autoref{fig:vidaily} and
\autoref{fig:vihourly} respectively. The most important features for
determining suitable forecast-models for daily time series are, strength
of seasonality corresponds to the weekly seasonality (7, measured by
seasonal\_strength1), stability, trend, lumpiness and linearity.
Strength of seasonality corresponds to the annual seasonality (365.25,
measured by seasonal\_strength2) is appeared to be important in
determining the selection of theta models. Furthermore, length of the
series is important in determining random walk, random walk with drift,
mstlarima, mstlets, stlar, theta and nn classes. \autoref{fig:dailypdp}
shows the partial dependency plots of the top 3 features from the FFORMS
framework. According to the results of \autoref{fig:dailypdp} shorter
series tends to select random walk with drift models while probability
of selecting snaive, mstlarima and mstlets models increases as the
length of series increases. Neural network models shows a non-monotonic
relationship with length of the series (N). The theta models tends to be
selected for series with high annual seasonality but very low weekly
seasonality. According to \autoref{fig:vihourly}, strength of daily
seasonality (period=24, measured by seasonal\_strength1) appear to be
more important than than the strength of weekly seasonality (period=168,
measured by seasonal\_strength2). Furthermore, entropy, linearity, sum
of squares of first 5 coefficients of PACF, curvature, trend, spikiness
and stability were found to be the most important features in
determining best forecasting method for hourly time series. Only snaive
category ranked N among top 5 for hourly time series. The strength of
seasonality corresponds to weekly seasonality also seems to be one of
the most important feature for the classes snaive, random walk,
mstlarima, and tbats. According to \autoref{fig:hourlypdp} probability
of selecting random walk, random walk with drift, theta model and white
noise process decreased with higher strength of daily
(seasonal\_strength1) seasonality, while the opposite relationship hold
for other classes. On the other hand, probability of selecting random
walk model increased with the increase in strength of weekly
seasonality.

For daily series within each category, sediff\_acf5 and weekly

\subsection{Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explanations}\label{local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations}

\autoref{fig:quarterlypca} shows the distribution of prediction space
across instance space for quarterly time series data.
\autoref{fig:quarterlypca} is a global representation of model-in-data
space. All classes clustered into particular region of the instance
space. However, we can not observe a clear separation of boundaries.
This is because it is hard to define a ``best'' forecast-model for a
given series, most time series could inherit a pattern of multiple types
of forecast-models. We now illustrate how LIME approach can be used to
zoom into local regions of the data to identify which features
contribute most to classify a specific instance. For the illustration we
select for different types of time series classified with high
probability. \autoref{fig:quarterlylime2} shows the feature contribution
for the instances highlighted on the PCA-space of quarterly series. We
can see how the different strength of seasonality influence the FFORMS
framework to select different types of seasonal forecast-models. For
example, SARIMA models was selected when the seasonality vary between
0.579 and 0.787 (case 1), ETS-seasonal models is selected when the
strength of seasonality is greater than 0.787 (case 4), random walk with
drift when the seasonality with lower than 0.579 (case 2) and for the
highly trended and seasonal series (strength of seasonality
\textgreater{} 0.895) ETS model with a trend and seasonal component is
selected (case 3). Further, high value of diff1y\_acf5 in supports the
selection of SARIMA for case 1 while, moderate value of diff1y\_acf5
supports the selection of ETS-seasonal for the case 4. Similarly, we can
explore the reasons for other instances in all frequency categories.
From LIME approach we can gain insight into the local neighbourhood
characteristics which lead to the choice of a particular neighbourhood
over alternative destinations.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Forecast model selection is both time and computer cost intensive
process. Consequently, the application of machine-learning approaches to
predict suitable forecasting model from large number of potentially
relevant time series features is a topic growing popularity in the field
of time series forecasting. In this paper we used model-agnostic machine
learning interpretability tools to explore what was happening under the
hood of FFORMS framework and to gain an understanding of what features
led to the choices of FFORMS framework. Further, explaining predictions
is an important aspect in getting humans trust and use the proposed
framework effectively, if the explanations are faithful and
intelligible. Humans usually have prior knowledge about the application
domain, which they can use to accept (trust) or reject prediction if
they understand the reasons behind it.

We explored the role of features in two different perspectives: i)
individual effect of feature, and ii) interaction effect of features.
Overall, the features strength of trend, strength of seasonality,
linearity, spikiness and curvature among the top 10 within each
frequency category. \textcite{lemke2010meta} also pointed out features
related to nonstationarity and seasonality of a series are important
factors for choosing a forecasting method. Features that frequently
appear can be considered as more relevant than those that tend to appear
less frequently. Partial dependency plots are used to visualize the
learned relationship between features and the model predictions. The
displayed relationships confirm to domain knowledge expectations.
However, since several number of features are used to build the
framework with comparable contributions, and thus, all individual
contributions are small. According to the results of daily and hourly
data we also observed neural network modelling model was appropriate for
forecasting high frequency data. In response to the results of the
M3-competition this has been pointed out by many commentators
\autocite{makridakis2000m3}. Further, our results show that the
performance of various methods depends upon the length of the time
series. Short time series tends to select simple methods such as random
walk models, snaive, etc. ETS models with both trend and seasonal
components, SARIMA models, mstl models tend to provide accurate
forecasts with longer time series as these are more parameterized
models.

As FFORMS framework is developed on top of random forest algorithm takes
into account every possible interactions. It was apparent from the heat
matrices of Friedman's H-Statistic presented that a substantial
interaction effect exist between the features. The strength trend showed
less interactivity in yearly series data,reflecting that these features
are more important on their own. The features involve in interaction and
their strength of interaction effect differ across the different
frequency categories (yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily and
hourly) as well as forecast-models (random walk, ETS models, etc.).
However, it is interesting to note that in each frequency category all
or subset of ACF/PACF-based features interact each other. This confirm
that information regarding correlation structure of the time series is
an essential information for the choice of model selection. A unique
pattern of interactivity exist within each class are useful for
separating one from another.

Exploration of conditions learnt by the FFORMS framework also support
practitioners to make a good educated guess on suitable forecast-model
for a given problem. Further the results of this study is useful in
identifying new ways to improve forecasting accuracy by capturing
different features of time series.
